- [ ] Ensure all images and assets are included

## GoDaddy Shared Hosting Steps

### 1. Build Your App

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Prepare Files

- Navigate to `dist/spa/` folder
- This contains your deployable files
- You'll upload ALL these files to GoDaddy

### 3. Access GoDaddy cPanel

1. Login to GoDaddy account
2. Go to "My Products" â†’ "Web Hosting" â†’ "Manage"
3. Click "cPanel Admin"

### 4. Upload to public_html

1. Open "File Manager" in cPanel
2. Navigate to `public_html` folder
3. **Delete any existing files** (especially index.html)
4. Upload ALL files from your `dist/spa/` folder
5. If you uploaded as ZIP, extract it

### 5. Upload .htaccess

- Upload the `.htaccess` file from `public/` folder to `public_html/`
- This ensures React Router works correctly

## Post-Deployment Verification
